Dimensionality reduction is the reduction technique is the transformation of data from high dimension to low dimensional space so that the low dimensional representation retains some proprties of actual data. 

Some of the dimenionality techniques popularly used are: PCA and t-sne

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): It is the linear transformation technique to convert the data, feature with high variance is considered.

t-SNE (t - Distributed Stochastic neighbour embedding) : The dimensionality reduction technique uses different values of perplexity and helps in data visualization. 

MNIST dataset is dataset with 60,000 small square 28 x 28 pixel grayscale images with digits from 0 - 9. In this demonstration, dimensionality reduction is applied on MNIST dataset.
